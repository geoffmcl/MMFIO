File: BUILD.txt

==================
'build' directory
==================

This is a cmake - http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html - build project

cmake is best run in an out-of-source folder. In this case the 'build' directory contains
a build-me.bat file to do teh configuration, generation and compile of the project.

If you have MSVC correctly install, cmake will default to generating a MSVC solution 
file, MMFIO.sln.

To run cmake in the default modes, it is only necessary to -
<source> cd build
<source\build> cmake .. [Generator]

Running cmake without any parameters will list the 'generators' available on your platform.
They should include several versions of MSVC, NMake build files, Watcom, MSYS, MingW, plus 
others.

=====================
'build.x64' directory
=====================

If you have a 64-bit install of MSVC then this folder constains a build-me.bat to build 
a 64-bit version.

=====================

Have fun.
